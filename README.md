## CIC | PCUBED
This research project was completed under the mentorship of *Dr. Doina Bein* as part of *California State University, Fullerton's* research program, **[CIC-PCUBED](https://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cicpcubed/index.php)**.

>"CIC|PCUBED is a grant-funded project that aims to increase the transfer, retention, and graduation rates of women in Computer Sciences at CSU Fullerton."

## Project Description:
- Built a *model* that predicts obesity rates in children by *training* existing data[^1] from previous years using **Python** and its *data analytical* tools/libraries: **Python, Numpy, Pandas, SkLearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Google CoLab**
- Highlighted the detrimental impact of obesity through a **presentation** that portrayed *creative visuals* analyzing the many *statistical data trends* based on an individualâ€™s different demographics to over *50 engineering mentors and peers*
